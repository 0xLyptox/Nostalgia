# Nostalgia

A highly concurrent actor-based C++ Minecraft server (currently supporting 1.14.4, protocol 498).

The actor framework the server is built upon is CAF (https://actor-framework.org/).

## Goal

The current purpose of the server is to serve as a playground for testing AI (bots) in Minecraft.

In the end, the server will play itself.
